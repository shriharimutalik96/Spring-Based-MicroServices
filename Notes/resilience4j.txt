Resilience4j : fault tolerance library : CircuitBreaker Framework
Resilience4j is a lightweight, easy-to-use fault tolerance library inspired by
Netflix Hystrix.

1) Retry :
	How many number of retry to the perticular rest client is allowed before the error is thrown'
	
2) CircuitBreaker : Open , Closed , Open-Closed
	If the huge number of calls are made to the rest client the circuitbreaker will move
	to the diffent states
	
3) Rate Limiting :  10s => 10,000 calls to sample-api :
 limiting the number of rest calls made to rest api per period of time 
 
4) Bulkhead :  how many concurrent calls are allowed : 10 concurrent calls
	we can send 10 concurrent calls to the rest api
